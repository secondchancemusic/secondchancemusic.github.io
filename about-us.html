	<h2>
		Hi we're Second Chance Music! We are an organization that collects old instruments, refurbishes them, and then donates them
		to schools in the local area. Our organization was started by a middle school student who recognized a need for musical 
		instruments in schools where students have a passion fot music, but lack the resources to obtain musical instruments.
